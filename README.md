# Naive Bayes

## Why do we call it Naive?
The Bayes theorem requires some independent assumptions and the it is the foundation of the Naive bayes machine learning algorithm and therefore the naive bayes machine learning
algorithm also relies on these assumptions which are often times not correct and therefore it's kind of naive to assume that they're going to be correct. That's the reason why it's called Naive Bayes.

## Dataset
This is a dataset containing 400 customers. Each row here represents a customer and for each customer we have two features: age and estimated salary, with which we are going to predict that dependent variable
purchased, which tells whether or not the customer bought the product. So zero means that indeed the customer didn't buy and one means that the customer bought it.
